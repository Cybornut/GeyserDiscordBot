Geyser is software that you can download and run yourself, so it doesn't have an IP. That being said, there are a few Geyser-related servies that do have an IP:

- There is an _unofficial_ instance of GeyserConnect at `geyserconnect.net` - run `!!geyserconnect` for more info.  This allows you to connect to any server without having to set up Geyser yourself but you may need a Java Edition account for online mode servers (`!!account` for more info). Note that it is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED to join servers such as Hypixel through this as you will likely get banned (see `!!anticheat`).

- If you just want to try out Geyser, we have a test server at `test.geysermc.org` - do `!!testserver` for more info.

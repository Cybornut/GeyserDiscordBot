Geyser is software that you can download and run yourself, so it doesn't have an IP. That being said, there are a few Geyser-related servies that do have an IP:

- There is an _unofficial_ instance of GeyserConnect (this is probably the easiest way to use Geyser) at `geyserconnect.net` - run `!!geyserconnect` in <#613194762249437245> for more info.

- If you just want to try out Geyser, we have a test server at `test.geysermc.org` - do `!!testserver` in <#613194762249437245> for more info.
